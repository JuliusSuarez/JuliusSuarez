## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to My GitHub!

Hello! I'm excited to be part of the GitHub community. As someone who's passionate about cybersecurity and education, I'm here to share and collaborate on projects that help people learn and grow, especially when it comes to using GitHub for coding, security, and more!

## About Me

New to GitHub: I'm exploring the features of GitHub to make my projects better and learn more about how it can help me and others.

Cybersecurity Enthusiast: I am passionate about staying safe online and teaching others about the importance of cybersecurity.

Education & Mentorship: I mentor students to help them learn new skills and build confidence, especially in the world of tech.

## What I'm Doing Here

Exploring GitHub Education: I am learning how GitHub can be a powerful tool for education and how to use it to create and share resources.

Mentoring: Helping students learn how to use GitHub in their projects and collaborations is my goal. Iâ€™m introducing them to version control, open-source contributions, and keeping their code secure.
